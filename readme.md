#Natours - Tour Booking Application
Natours is a sophisticated web application built with modern technologies, enabling users to seamlessly book tours, manage accounts, and create various entities (such as users, bookings, tours, and reviews) through both the user interface (UI) and the backend.

Features
User Account Management: Users can sign up and log in using their email addresses, with a unique restriction on domain validation for email sign-ups.
Tour Booking: Allows users to view available tours and make bookings directly via the UI.
Admin Dashboard: Through the backend, administrators can manage the application by creating and managing tours, users, bookings, and reviews.
Reviews: Users can leave reviews on tours, which can be managed and updated by admins from the backend.
Technologies Used
Node.js: A powerful JavaScript runtime for building scalable and high-performance server-side applications.
Express.js: A lightweight and flexible Node.js framework used to structure the backend APIs and handle routing efficiently.
MongoDB & Mongoose: MongoDB serves as the NoSQL database to store data, and Mongoose is used to handle data modeling and interaction with the database.
Parcel: A zero-config bundler used for compiling and bundling the frontend assets.
